<h4>About Us
Located in the heart of Old Newmarket, Lemon Lime Interior Design has worked closely with clients in the GTA, Newmarket, Aurora and the Muskokas for over 15 years. We have happy clients who have transformed their condominiums, lofts, houses, cottages and commercial spaces with our fresh approach to design.

At Lemon Lime, we understand that no two people are alike and we take the time to understand each individual's needs and desires in order to expertly guide them through all aspects of a project to make it uniquely their own. Whether it is designing a new bathroom, kitchen, office space, re-upholstering your favourite furniture, hanging new drapery or fully renovating your entire space, we are dedicated to helping our clients love their new spaces.

We explore all creative options to design with the best use of space while blending form, function and comfort. No project is too small or too big and each project is given the same professional attention and care. We pride ourselves in exceeding your expectations.
